# Scribe: A To-do List App by Aiden Redmond

Development Cycle: Saturday October 7th - ???

Welcome to scribe! Scribe is a project based on my desperate need for a todo-list app just the way i want it. I've tried just about every form of a to-do list: whiteboard, notebook, hand, todoist, things3, calendar blocking, and no to-do list. None of them quite did it for me. They were too ugly, inconvient, overcomplicated, too simple, or just... not right. So, I took it upon myself to make my own! While practicing some real world skills like back-end database implementation, webpack watching, & UI/UX Design.
